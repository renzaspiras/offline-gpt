# Offline GPT

Offline GPT is a lightweight, offline chat model based on GPT architecture. It's designed to provide conversational capabilities without relying on an internet connection. This repository offers an easy installation process for users to deploy the model in various environments.

## Installation

Please note that for non-rooted systems, you need to install a modified version of Termux with the appropriate architecture. Follow these steps:

1. Install the modified Termux from [here](https://github.com/renzaspiras/arch-termux.git), ensuring it matches your device architecture.
2. Add the Offline GPT repository:

cm add https://github.com/renzaspiras/offline-gpt.git
```

### Other Operating Systems

Support for other operating systems will be added soon. Stay tuned for updates!

## Usage
Once installed, you can interact with the GPT model through your preferred command-line interface. Simply invoke the model and start chatting. To exit the application, input `exit`. Here's an example of how to use it:
```bash
